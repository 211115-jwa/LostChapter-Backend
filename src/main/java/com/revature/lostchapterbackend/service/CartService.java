/*Front End Implementations notes
 * If the user is not logged in they will not be able to use the cart feature.
 * However, to get around this we can add a new cart to the table without a user. 
 * the cart id must be stored in the front end and compared as a global variable whenever doing login checks
 * The cart id essentially becomes the identifier of the non-logged in person
 * when the person logs in the cart should compared to the current cart then combined 
 * Last delete the cart that was used when user was not logged in
 * Same goes for registering
 * But instead of deleting the cart if they decide to register we set the current carts' user to the newly created user 
 * We should set a timer and if the timer runs out when the user is not logged in then the cart gets deleted

 *  Verify there is inventory of product when adding to cart.
